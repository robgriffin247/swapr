# SWAPR

SWAPR (*swapper*) is a project to demonstrate the use of R for data engineering. It will, among other things:

1. Demonstrate how to extract data from the Star Wars API (**SWAPI**)
1. Load SWAPI data into a DuckDB and/or Snowflake database
1. Serve production ready datasets
1. Utilise production ready datasets in a Shiny web app

### Using R

R is a statistical programming language, so it is designed around the use of data &mdash; data transformation, data visualisation and data analysis are all strengths of R. Data engineers will be most interested in the potential for transforming data, while the popularity of the language among data scientists could improve collaboration between these two user groups.

R is an interpreted programming language, so you will need to install an interpreter. While you can download the interpreter and a basic command-line gui from the Comprehensive R Archive Netwrok (**CRAN**), most R developers are using a more feature-rich third-party development environment. Most popular in the R user community is [**RStudio**](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (currently rebranding to **Posit**, as it now does much more than just R).
